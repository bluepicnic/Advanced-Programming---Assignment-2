Indentation style is Stroustrup, with { used on the same line except when implementing a function. New lines are used when determining logic flow to improve readability by controlling the verticality of my code. 

My naming convention follows some of Stroustrup's recommendations including capitalising the first letters of variables names (to differentiate them from C++'s built in types and avoiding full capitalisation to prevent clashes with Macros, which, admitedly, go unused in my code.

Stroustrup recommends that his rules should be used as a guideline only if there are no solid standards to adhere to or if the developer has no better ideas. With that in mind, I adapted some of his standards and applied some of my own preferences to create the programming style which I attempted to consistently follow throughout the project.  

Following these principles, I also made use of enumerated classes to prevent unwanted type conversion for my state enums.
